Introducing Hooks

-allow you to use state and other react features without using class components

-state cannot be used in a functional component without Hooks
    -useState is a hook that allows you to use state in functional hook
    -no need to use component did mount

-useEffect() and useState() are common hooks to use

-we had to use class components for the following reasons:
    -to keep data in state
    -to use lifecycle methods
    -to pass props from classes to functional components

-however!  with react hooks, we can do all of this without using classes!!  WOOT WOOT!


first we will use class to create counter app:
-use create-react-app <appname> in terminal in desired dir.
-go to src folder in new app and remove all files you don't need: (everything but App.js and index.js)

-to begin remove all references in App.js and index.js and we will write class component in the App.js
for this exercise.
